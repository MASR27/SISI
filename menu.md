## Introduction

In gas stations, accurate and reliable measurement of fuel and other products is critical to ensure customer satisfaction and compliance with regulatory requirements. ISO 10012:2003 provides a framework for the management of measurement processes and the requirements for measurement management systems. By implementing a measurement management system that complies with this standard, gas stations can improve the accuracy and reliability of their measurements and reduce the risk of errors and non-compliance.

## Scope

ISO 10012:2003 is applicable to any organization that performs measurements as part of its activities, including gas stations. The standard is also applicable to all types of measurements, regardless of the measurement method or the type of measurement equipment used.

## Normative references

ISO 9000:2000 - Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary
ISO/IEC 17025:1999 - General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories

## Terms and definitions

The standard provides definitions for the following terms:

- Measurement management system
- Measurement process
- Measurement equipment
- Measurement standard
- Measurement traceability
- Measurement uncertainty
- Calibration
- Verification

## Requirements for measurement management systems

The standard outlines the requirements for the implementation and maintenance of a measurement management system. In gas stations, this includes the following:

- Documented procedures for the measurement of fuel and other products, including the use of approved measurement equipment and measurement standards
- Procedures for the selection and maintenance of measurement equipment, including fuel dispensers and storage tanks
- Procedures for calibration and verification of measurement equipment
- Procedures for the handling of non-conforming measurement equipment and processes
- Procedures for the storage and handling of measurement data

## Management responsibility

The standard specifies the responsibilities of top management in the implementation and maintenance of the measurement management system. In gas stations, this includes the following:

- Ensuring the availability of resources for the implementation and maintenance of the measurement management system
- Ensuring that the measurement management system is documented, implemented, and maintained
- Establishing and reviewing the quality policy and objectives related to measurement processes, including the accurate and reliable measurement of fuel and other products
- Ensuring that all personnel involved in measurement processes are competent
- Reviewing the effectiveness of the measurement management system

## Measurement system analysis

The standard outlines the requirements for the analysis of measurement systems, including the following:

- Determination of the type
